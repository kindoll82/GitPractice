Hi my name is Andrew Liao. 

I would describe myself as curious, big, and tall.

My favorite hobby is to build things. Regardless of the medium, I like to think of an idea and make it exist in the physical world. 

My favorite animal are otters. They swim really well and seem to be very calm. I'm big on swimming and I often envy our mammalian cousins that are built so well for the water.
