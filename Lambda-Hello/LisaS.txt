My name is Lisa Sampson. Three words people often use to describe me are as follows: friendly, helpful, and short. One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I love books that can suck me into their world and make me feel for characters who I know arenâ€™t real. When an author can make me feel part of the story, it makes me smile.
