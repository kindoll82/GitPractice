Hi I'm Stefano from Zurich, Switzerland. A small country in the centre of Europe.

Three words that best describe me are: thoughtful, collaborative, and open-minded.

I love to do sports, especially cycling, which keeps me from going completely crazy (some level of craziness is fine though). I'm a dog person. I would love to have a Golden Retriever or a Viszla one day.
