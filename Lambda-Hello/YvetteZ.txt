Hi my name is Yvette Zhukovsky
I am a mother. I would really love to learn programming. I tried many times unsuccessfully and hopefully this time it works. 

I like spending time with my daughter. Watch her swim for her team. 

I really like cats but everybody in my family are allergic to cats so I can't have a cat.
