Hey! My name's Ariel McLaughlin and I'm from Rexburg, Idaho.

Three words that describe me are "outgoing", energetic", "athletic".
My favorite hobbies would probably be Gymnastics, Violin, and I like to read.
My favorite animal has always been an Elephant. I don't know what it is about them, but they're so cool.
